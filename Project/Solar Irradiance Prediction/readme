 Project: Predicting Solar Energy Production

This project aims to develop a model to predict how much solar energy a location can generate. 

Project Goal:

 Build a model that predicts solar irradiance (solar energy reaching Earth's surface) using historical weather data.

Project Benefits:

 This model can be used to:
     Optimize placement of solar panels
     Forecast energy production from solar farms
     Improve grid integration of solar power

Data Description:

 We will use weather data collected from a weather station over four months.
 The data includes:
     Temperature
     Humidity
     Barometric pressure
     Wind direction & speed
     Sunrise/sunset times
     Solar radiation (target variable)

Project Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing:
     Clean and organize the data
     Extract relevant features (e.g., time of day, month)
     Select the most informative features for prediction

2. Feature Engineering:
     Apply transformations to improve model performance (e.g., scaling, normalization)

3. Model Building:
     Train a model (XGBoost) to predict solar irradiance based on weather data

4. Evaluation:
     Assess the model's accuracy in predicting solar energy production

Expected Outcome:

A model that can accurately predict solar irradiance based on weather data. This model can be used to estimate electricity generation from solar panels, aiding in planning and optimizing solar energy use.
